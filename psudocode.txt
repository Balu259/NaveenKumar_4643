Load the dataset: Load the dataset that you want to build a decision tree classifier for.
                  The dataset should have instances represented as rows and features represented as columns,
                  along with corresponding class labels.

Split the dataset: Split the dataset into a training set and a test set. This is done to evaluate              
                   the performance of the decision tree classifier on unseen data.

Build the decision tree: Use the training set to build a decision tree classifier. To do this,you can use a recursive
                      algorithm that splits the data based on the feature that provides the maximum information gain. 
                      The information gain is a measure of the reduction in entropy achieved by splitting the data based 
                      on a particular feature. The decision tree should continue to split the data until all instances in a
                      node belong to the same class or a predefined stopping criterion (e.g., maximum depth) is reached.

Evaluate the decision tree: Use the test set to evaluate the performance of the decision tree classifier. 
                       This can be done by comparing the predicted class labels with the actual class labels 
                       and calculating a performance metric such as accuracy or F1-score.

Prune the decision tree (optional): If the decision tree overfits the training set, meaning that it is too complex and performs 
                        poorly on the test set, you can prune the decision tree to simplify it. One way to do this is to remove
                        branches that do not significantly improve the classification performance on the test set.

Use the decision tree: Once you have built and evaluated the decision tree classifier, you can use it to classify new instances.
                        To do this, you traverse the decision tree from the root node to a leaf node based on the feature values 
                        of the instance being classified, and return the class label associated with the leaf node.

                  These are the main steps involved in building a decision tree classifier model. Keep in mind that there are many variations 
and extensions to this basic algorithm, such as using different splitting criteria, handling missing values, and dealing with categorical
 features.
